Welcome! You will be the code breaker.

You need to guess a 4 color ordered combination.

Colors are Red(r), Green(g), Blue(b),
White(w), Cyan(c) and Magenta(m)

Each letter represents a colored peg.
For example if you want to guess a combination RED GREEN BLUE CYAN
type rgbc. Press enter to finish your turn.

After each turn the computer will tell you which colors are correct,
which are correct colors BUT in the wrong place and
which colors are not in the code.


You have 12 guesses to figure out the code. Good luck!
